# 📊 Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Matrix

## Executive Summary

This risk matrix provides a comprehensive assessment of identified security threats, their likelihood and impact, and prioritized mitigation strategies. Risks are scored using a **Likelihood × Impact** methodology aligned with NIST CSF and industry best practices.

---

## Risk Scoring Methodology

### **Likelihood Scale**
- 🔴 **High (3):** Threat is actively being exploited; multiple attack vectors exist
- 🟠 **Medium (2):** Threat is plausible; some exploitation evidence exists
- 🟡 **Low (1):** Threat is theoretical; limited active exploitation

### **Impact Scale**
- 🔴 **High (3):** Critical business disruption; data breach; regulatory violation
- 🟠 **Medium (2):** Significant operational impact; partial data loss
- 🟡 **Low (1):** Minor disruption; limited financial impact

### **Risk Level Calculation**
```
Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact

Critical (9): 3×3
High (6-8): 2×3, 3×2, 2×2
Medium (2-4): 1×3, 2×1, 1×2
Low (1): 1×1
```
