1. Executive Summary

This report consolidates findings from:
	â€¢	A simulated ransomware incident response against AIG (based on CISA alerts)
	â€¢	A threat intelligence assessment of APT34, a state-sponsored adversary linked to Iran

Overall Security Posture: ðŸŸ  Moderate-to-High Risk
	â€¢	Environment vulnerable to both opportunistic ransomware attacks and targeted nation-state activity.
	â€¢	Key gaps include: weak IAM enforcement, phishing exposure, lateral movement opportunities, and outdated components.

2. Ransomware Incident Response (Simulation)

2.1 Incident Timeline

Time (UTC)	Event	Action Taken
08:15	CISA JSON alert received	Parsed IOCs with ransomware_alert_analysis.py
08:20	Encrypted ZIP detected	Launched brute-force recovery via password_bruteforce.py
08:45	Password cracked	Decryption tool recovered test files
09:00	Stakeholders alerted	Critical advisory email sent
09:30	Documentation completed	Incident report drafted


â¸»

2.2 Findings
	â€¢	Vulnerabilities: Weak password protection, reliance on unpatched RDP.
	â€¢	Strengths: Effective alerting and recovery simulation, quick stakeholder comms.

â¸»

2.3 Recommendations
	â€¢	Enforce MFA for all privileged accounts.
	â€¢	Harden RDP exposure and restrict to VPN.
	â€¢	Establish a 72-hour SLA for patching high-severity vulnerabilities.

3. Threat Intelligence Report â€“ APT34

3.1 Profile (from Threat Intel Report ï¿¼)
	â€¢	Origin: Iran-linked, active since ~2014
	â€¢	Targets: Energy, telecom, government, critical infrastructure
	â€¢	Tools: PowerShell, custom backdoors (BONDUPDATER, SEASHARPEE)
	â€¢	Motives: Espionage, long-term network persistence

3.2 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Tactic	Technique	Description
Initial Access	Spearphishing (T1566.001)	Malicious attachments/links
Execution	PowerShell (T1059.001)	Malicious script execution
Persistence	Scheduled Tasks (T1053.005)	Maintains long-term access
Credential Access	Dumping (T1003)	Steals login credentials
C2	Encrypted Channels (T1071)	HTTP/S for remote control


â¸»

3.3 Impact Assessment
	â€¢	Confidentiality: High risk of exfiltration of sensitive data
	â€¢	Integrity: Risk of tampering with systems/data
	â€¢	Availability: No major disruption observed, but persistence allows future compromise

â¸»

3.4 Recommendations

Immediate: Reset credentials, scan for persistence, patch vulnerabilities
Short-Term: Deploy MFA, strengthen email security, roll out EDR tools
Long-Term: Regular threat hunts, staff phishing training, Zero Trust architecture

â¸»

4. Combined Risk Matrix

Threat	Likelihood	Impact	Risk Level	Mitigation Strategy
Ransomware (CISA IOC)	High	High	ðŸ”´ Critical	Patch systems, enforce MFA, disable RDP
APT34 Lateral Movement	Medium	High	ðŸŸ  High	Network segmentation, deploy EDR
Phishing	High	Medium	ðŸŸ  High	Training, MFA, email filtering
Data Exfiltration	Medium	High	ðŸŸ  High	DLP, encrypted channels, SIEM
Zero-Day Exploit	Low	High	ðŸŸ¡ Medium	Virtual patching, threat intel
Insider Threat	Medium	Medium	ðŸŸ¡ Medium	IAM controls, UEBA, logging
Outdated Components	High	Low	ðŸŸ¡ Medium	Automated patching


â¸»

5. Final Recommendations
	1.	IAM Security: Enforce MFA, review least-privilege roles quarterly.
	2.	Monitoring & Detection: Deploy SIEM & EDR for endpoint and network visibility.
	3.	Incident Response Readiness: Run quarterly tabletop exercises.
	4.	Threat Hunting: Continuous monitoring for APT34 TTPs.
	5.	Zero Trust Adoption: Segmentation, strong access validation.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also generate the PDF export version (with a nice report-style layout), or keep it Markdown-only for GitHub?
