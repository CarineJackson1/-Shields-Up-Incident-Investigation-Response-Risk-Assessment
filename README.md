# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Incident Investigation & Threat Intelligence Reporting

## 📚 Overview

Welcome to the world of cybersecurity! In this project, you'll take on the role of a **cybersecurity consultant at Datacom**, investigating a real-world-style cyberattack. One of our high-profile tech clients has been targeted by a sophisticated **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** group—**APT34**, suspected to be backed by a foreign government. Sensitive data has been stolen, and the client's systems remain vulnerable.

You'll learn how cybersecurity professionals investigate such incidents, assess threats, and help organizations recover and build stronger defenses.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

* How cybersecurity consultants evaluate and respond to sophisticated attacks
* Core cybersecurity concepts including threats, vulnerabilities, and the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
* Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT34
* How to produce professional reports with findings and actionable recommendations

## 🛠️ What You'll Do

You will conduct a structured investigation into a simulated cyberattack and create a professional-grade report. The project is broken down into key tasks:

### ✅ Task 1: Investigate APT34 & Assess the Breach

You will begin by stepping into your role as a cybersecurity consultant:

* **Background**:
  A major client has been breached by **APT34**, a well-known threat group. The attack has resulted in the theft of customer data and intellectual property. Your task is to conduct **initial threat research** and **evaluate the potential impact** on the organization’s information security.

* **Objective**:

  * Research APT34’s background, motivations, and TTPs
  * Assess the breach’s potential impact on the client’s network and data
  * Understand core cybersecurity principles and how they relate to this attack
  * Prepare a detailed report documenting findings and recommendations

* **Deliverable**:
  A comprehensive **Initial Threat Intelligence Report**, including:

  * Overview of APT34
  * Attack methods and likely breach vectors
  * Impact assessment based on the CIA triad
  * Key recommendations to improve the client's cybersecurity posture

---

## 📄 Final Deliverable

At the conclusion of the project, you will submit a **Cybersecurity Incident Report** that includes:

* Executive Summary
* Technical Findings
* Threat Actor Profile (APT34)
* Attack Timeline
* Impact Analysis
* Remediation Strategies & Recommendations
