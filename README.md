📚 Project Overview

This project unifies hands-on technical simulation (ransomware attack response) with consulting-style risk assessment (APT34 investigation).

It demonstrates both tactical response and strategic planning, covering the lifecycle of modern cybersecurity operations:
	•	Detection & Analysis: Using CISA threat intelligence and MITRE ATT&CK
	•	Response & Recovery: Incident handling, decryption simulation, stakeholder communications
	•	Risk Assessment: OSINT investigation, mapping APT34 TTPs, and applying a risk matrix
	•	Reporting: Professional-grade documentation for both technical and non-technical stakeholders

⸻

🧰 Tools & Technologies
	•	🐍 Python (alert parsing, brute-force recovery tool)
	•	🗂 JSON/CSV (CISA alert processing)
	•	🔍 OSINT Tools: Shodan, VirusTotal, OTX, SecurityTrails
	•	🧩 MITRE ATT&CK (threat mapping)
	•	📄 Markdown & PDF reports (stakeholder communications, risk assessments)

⸻

🔍 Key Components

1️⃣ Ransomware Response Module
	•	ransomware_alert_analysis.py: Parses CISA alerts → CSV report of IOCs
	•	file_decryptor_sim.py: Simulates recovery of encrypted files
	•	password_bruteforce.py: Ethical brute-force exercise for encrypted ZIP recovery
	•	stakeholder_emails/: Pre-built templates for crisis communications
	•	incident_report.md: Timeline of events + mitigation steps

2️⃣ Threat Investigation & Risk Assessment Module
	•	APT34 Threat Intel Report (OSINT + MITRE ATT&CK mapping of TTPs)
	•	Cyber Risk Matrix: Evaluates Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impact
	•	Risk Assessment Report: Identifies vulnerabilities, prioritizes risks, and recommends mitigations

📊 Outcomes

✅ Hands-on ransomware incident response with recovery simulation
✅ OSINT-powered analysis of nation-state threat actors (APT34)
✅ Professional-grade threat intelligence + risk assessment reporting
✅ Crisis communication templates tailored for stakeholders
✅ Stronger detection, response, and risk management skills demonstrated

⸻

📧 Sample Stakeholder Communication

🚨 Critical Alert Advisory

Notifies infrastructure owners of active ransomware threats referencing CISA/FBI/NSA alerts with actionable steps:
	•	Enforce MFA
	•	Patch vulnerable services
	•	Lock down RDP exposure

⸻

🏁 Final Deliverables
	•	🐍 Python tools for alert parsing & brute-force recovery
	•	📄 APT34 Threat Intelligence Report
	•	📄 Cyber Risk Assessment Report (Risk Matrix)
	•	📨 Stakeholder Communication Templates (TXT/PDF)
	•	📑 Incident Report & Timeline
